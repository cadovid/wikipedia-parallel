# Analyzing Wikipedia Pages using MapReduce techniques

In this project a grep algorithm is implemented in Python by using MapReduce techniques for a given dataset. The main functionalities of this command are the following:

  - Search for all occurrences of a string in all of the files.
  - Provide a case-insensitive option to the search.
  - Refine the result by providing the specific locations of the files.
